# User-Task-Assignment
This is a simple project that consists of an user task assignment. An administrator can add new users, and can create new tasks for each one. An user can see their tasks, and check them when they are completed.

The main reason for this project is to learn a backend framework like Symfony, as well as other useful tools like Datatable and Swal.
